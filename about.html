                <p>Hello!</p>
                <p>Born in New York and raised in Vancouver, I grew up in a privileged household of doctors - from internists to neurosurgeons to a veterinarian (hey, that's me!). Tired of living an involuntary nomadic life among the US, Canada, and Taiwan, the one area of my life I was able to take solice in knowing that I had control over, was my choice in profession - or so I thought.</p>
                <p>In combining my love for animals and the push and pull to follow the medical footsteps of my pedigree, I pursued the ultimate compromise that was to become a veterinarian. After 4 years at Washington University in St. Louis for my BA in Biology, 4 years at Western University of Health Sciences for my DVM, and 1 year at Inland Valley Veterinary Specialists and Emergency Services for a shiny plaque, I have come to realize that a compromise of passion is unsustainable for fulfilment in any profession.</p>
                <p>Thus, we venture into the exciting world of a quarter-life crisis. With the house of horrors that is regret, the rollercoaster of emotion, and the funhouse of anxiety; the one light at the end of the tunnel is the knowledge - nay - the fact, that I am following a passion untainted by the imposed and unimposed will of others. Never have I been so eager to learn and so excited to contribute. I can finally be proud to do some good for the world in following my goals.</p>
                <p>And what are those goals?</p>

                <p>Nothing!</p>
                <p>The sole purpose of this website is to serve as practice grounds in applying what I've learned through self-study.</p>
                <p>Various iterations (this is the third one) will see improvements to the website. Down the road, this site will also serve as an <span style="font-weight: bold;color:#e8491d">informal</span> portfolio of my work and blog of my progress.</p>
                <p>Please have a look around, have fun, you break it you buy it, and uhh, don't resize your browser. Thanks.</p>
